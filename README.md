# Assignment
Read a number of 3D point positions from a OBJ file and render them onto
the screen. Besides becoming familiar with the linear algebra involved in rendering 3D scenes,
this project will get me familiar with the tools and libraries that are used while working with OpenGL
. These include GLFW and GLEW, as well as GLM.

## Features 
The bunny is spinning along the Y-axis while the dragon spins along the X-axis.
There are also added hotkeys to preform various actions:
- ‘p'/P'': scale down/up the size of each point as mentioned
- ‘a'/d'': move left/right (along the x axis) by a small amount
- 'w'/'s': move down/up (along the y axis) by a small amount
- 'z'/'Z': move into/out of the screen (along the z axis) by a small amount
- 'c'/'C': scale down/up (about the model's center, not the center of thescreen)
- 'r': reset position (move objects back to center of screen, without changing orientation or scale factor
- 'R': reset orientation and scale factor, but leave the objects where they are
